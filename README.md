Hi. Honestly kind of surprised you found my Github and bothered to read this README.

But while you're here, let me know how I can explain anything you see better.

My personal page used to have a blog, but I don't care about that really other than I was told to make one. So I got rid of it.

It was custom, if that interests you, and you can view it in the repo history (but it's gone now).

If you've actually read this, request a dollar from me on venmo (@Deeter-Cesler I think) with a message "I read your github!" and I'll legit send you one. Limit to like, 100 people, because I'm not made of venmos.
